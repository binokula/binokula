This includes: Getting access to a Binokula tenant Building and publishing report in Power BI Desktop Providing access to reports in Binokula Automating the refresh of data in reports Getting a Binokula Tenant A Binokula Tenant is your dedicated area for publishing, hosting and managing access to your report content. Only organizations who wish to share and control access to report need a tenant. If you are expecting to just access reports in Binokula, you will need to be added as a user on a tenant. If you are an organization who wishes to get a trial tenant, please contact sales@binokula.com . If you are expecting to already have access to reports in Binokula, you can enter your email address at https://binokula.app or contact the orgnization whose report content you wish to access. Building and Publishing Reports Building a Report without RLS Binokula uses Microsoft Power BI as its report building tool. For a report to be correctly published in Binokula, the report has to adhere to the following prequisites: Must have a security role called \"User_Security\" in the Power BI Model. Show \"User_Security\" example Should have a DAX filter on the Entity to User Mapping List which uses the USERNAME() function. (Only required for Row-Level-Security) Show USERNAME() example Building a Report with RLS Building a report with RLS requires the report to adhere to the following prerequisites: Must have a security role called \"User_Security\" in the Power BI Model. Show \"User_Security\" example Must have a DAX filter on the Entity to User Mapping List which uses the USERNAME() function. (Only required for Row-Level-Security) Show USERNAME() example Cross filter direction should be set to Both for the relationship with Entity to User Mapping List Apply security filter in both directions should be ticked for the relationship with Entity to User Mapping List Show Cross Filter and Apply Security Fiter Both example Testing Power BI RLS Once you have configure the RLS as shown above, you can test the security by impersonating a user. This is done by: Click \"View as Roles\" in Power BI Desktop; Tick \"Other User\" and enter the test user's email address; and Tick \"User_Security\" and click OK. Show \"View as Roles\" screen Any report you view now be secured for the specific user. Publishing Power BI Reports Once you have have built and tested your Power BI report, the next step is to publish the report to your dedicated tenant. This is done with the unique publisher account, whose details you would have received as part of requesting your Binokula tenant. You can sign-in with the publisher account by clicking on \"Sign in\" in Power BI Desktop. If you are already signed in with a different account, click on the account name and select \"Switch account\". Once you are signed in, you can publish the report by: Saving any changes; Clicking on the \"Publish\" button on the Home menu; and Choosing \"binokula\" as the destination before clicking \"Select\" Note: Save the report with a friendly name that you would wnat your users to see. Try to avoid something abbreviations and version numbers like \"test_fin_HL_V0.13\". Editing an existing report can be done by re-publishing the same report from Power BI Desktop. Select Yes when prompted to overwrite the dataset. Another way to edit an existing report is by making changes on powerbi.com with your publisher account. Re-publishing from Power BI Desktop will override these changes. Report for Mobile Viewing Power BI Mobile support are supported by Binokula. All you need to do is create the mobile view of a report in the Power BI Desktop file and publish it to your tenant. Please see Microsoft's Power BI Phone Report documentation for more information on configuring phone layout on Power BI Desktop. Show Phone Layout option in Power BI Desktop Managing access to reports in Binokula Any new report published are by default not accessible to any users. Access to reports are controlled through report groups. To give yourself access to view a report, you will need to be an administrator and complete the following in Binokula: Import the report definition into Binokula by clicking on the refresh button in the reports administration page; Creating a new Report Group in the report group administration page; Adding the new report to the Report Group; Adding yourself as a user in the report group; and Selecting the report in the Reports user page. Assigning more users and reports The process is exactly the same as the previous step, all you have to do is add more users. If will be too time-consuming to add users by one-by-one, you can create a script to call Binokula REST API to add users in bulk. Please see the developer guide for details on the REST API. If you need to expose more than one report to a specific audience, multiple reports can also be added to a report group through the Report Group administration page. Note: Currently communication to end users are managed by tenant administrators. However, you can send a forgot password link to users directly in the User Management administration page. Typical onboarding communication contains a link to the binokula.app page with instruction to enter their email address and then click the reset password link. Automating and scheduling the refresh of report data Refreshing data for Binokula reports is the same as any other Power BI report*. Any on-premise data used in the report needs to be supported by the Power BI On-Premise Data Gateway. The on-premise data gateway needs to be installed and configured with credentials of your unique publisher account. Cloud data sources also needs to be supported by the Power BI service. Additional information on Power BI's data refresh capabilities can be found here: Data refresh in Power BI Refresh Data Sources from Power BI Desktop *The Power BI Data Model still needs to have the \"User_Security\" role created in Power BI Desktop. Once you have a on-premise data gateway configured, you can access powerbi.com with your assigned publisher account and configure the schedule refresh as per the Power BI Documentation .","title":"Admin Guide"},{"location":"admin-guide/#admin-guide","text":"","title":"Admin Guide"},{"location":"admin-guide/#getting-started","text":"This guide will take you through all the required steps for providing secure reporting to your stakeholder.

Current end-points focus on user management and access to reports. All API calls are secured with SSL, tenant names and API Keys (client_secret). If you need access to your client_secret, please contact support@binokula.app . Single-Sign On Overview Single-Sign On (SSO) enables external applications to give users access to Binokula without the need for them to enter their Binokula password. Access to Binokula is gained with the combination of a user's email address and a securely generated access token. The access token is valid for one hour and can be refreshed using the API. Binokula will check if the users email is registered as a system user and if the access token is valid before granting access to the application. If authentication fails, a redirect to the Binokula login page will be executed.
