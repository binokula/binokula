###What is Binokula?
Binokula is a report sharing website which makes it possible for organization's to securely share reports with other business affiliates. Binokula attempts to address all the problems associated with secure report sharing. Once you have a Binokula tenant for your organization, you will be able to:

* Expose secure, interactive reports using Microsoft's Power BI.
* Build reports with Row-Level Security (RLS) with the need of a software developer.
* Allow users to access their reports and date AND ONLY THEIR REPORTS AND DATA.
* Scale to thousands of users without being concerned about how they will be licensed.
* See when users access their reports.
* Change existing reports or add new reports without the need of a software developer.
* Automate the entire process, while knowing that we constantly monitor the platform for you.
